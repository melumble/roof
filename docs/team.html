                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>Roof was born from a simple observation: property management shouldn't be complicated. Whether
                        you're a landlord managing multiple properties or a renter trying to pay rent and report
                        maintenance issues, the process has traditionally been frustrating and fragmented.</p>
                    <p>We set out to build a solution that brings everyone together on one platform, making property
                        management transparent, efficient, and stress-free.</p>

                        <p class="team-bio">Hello, my name is Kingsley, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor’s
                            degree in Computer Science at the University of Utah, supported by an educational background
                            in aviation. I am particularly interested in how complex information can be structured and
                            presented clearly, aiming to use intelligent algorithms and intuitive interfaces to create
                            reliable and understandable user experiences. I am also drawn to cybersecurity, Android
                            development, and decision-support systems, continually exploring how to balance technical
                            precision with real user needs.<br><br>

                            In the Roof capstone project, I focused on integrating modern AI tools, scalable backend
                            services, and user-oriented interface design to improve the overall living experience. My
                            goal was to lower communication barriers and support smoother coordination among renters
                            through thoughtful technological design.<br><br>

                            Outside of academics, I enjoy working on small creative projects, as well as photography,
                            traveling, badminton, and swimming. Looking ahead, I hope to combine technology, aesthetics,
                            and human-centered thinking to build products that carry both practical value and emotional
                            warmth.</p>

                        <p class="team-bio">Hello! I'm Quinn, a combined BS/MS Computer Science student who worked
                            across Roof's entire stack. In particular, I built the augmented reality furniture capture
                            feature, which lets users visualize items in their own space before making decisions. I also
                            developed an AI-powered smart fill tool that helps users create and write detailed
                            maintenance requests using just a photo.<br><br>
                            Beyond Roof, I work with a research team at the Huntsman Cancer Institute on AI-driven
                            protein folding. I contribute to projects that use machine learning to predict protein
                            structures and interactions, and I am exploring how computational tools can accelerate the
                            development of new therapeutics. This experience has pushed me to pursue specializing in
                            Artificial Intelligence.<br><br>
                            Outside of work, I love playing tennis, riding bikes, and traveling to places where Google
                            Maps just shrugs.</p>

                        <p class="team-bio">Hi! I’m Mel and I will be graduating this December with a Bachelor’s in
                            Computer Science with an emphasis in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Over the
                            last year building Roof, I have been involved in full-stack development across the app, with
                            a focus on AI integration and analytics tools. Some of the features I led included an AI
                            lease summarization and document-chat tools, income summaries and financial analysis for
                            landlords, and maintenance request creation for renters. <br><br>
                            Outside of Roof, I work with research groups at the Huntsman Cancer Institute, where I
                            develop novel protein designs using AI models, and with the Kahlert School of Computing
                            Security and Learning Threats Lab, where I explore LLM prompt-injection mitigation methods.
                            Working at the intersection of AI, data pipelines, and mobile applications has shown me how
                            integrating these components can amplify a project’s impact and deliver solutions
                            efficiently. As a software engineer, I’m especially passionate about this integration and
                            the creative problem-solving it enables.<br><br>
                            When I’m not working on projects, you can usually find me outside skiing, mountain biking,
                            or playing tennis.

                        <p class="team-bio">Hi! My name is Eric, a soon-to-be graduate with a Bachelor’s in Computer
                            Science and Psychology from the University of Utah. On this capstone project, I primarily
                            contributed as a full-stack developer, applying both my technical background and my interest
                            in human-centered design to build a product that is intuitive, accessible, and grounded in
                            strong usability principles. I enjoyed working across the stack, but I especially focused on
                            shaping the user experience and ensuring our design choices aligned with how real people
                            think, perceive, and interact with technology.<br><br>
                            Throughout my academic and research experience, I’ve developed a strong interest in human
                            factors, cognitive psychology, and the ways immersive technologies like VR influence
                            perception and behavior. I hope to continue working at the intersection of psychology and
                            computing, designing systems that feel natural, supportive, and user-aligned.<br><br>
                            Outside of academics, I love snowboarding, hiking, and exploring creative projects that
                            blend technology and design. I’m always excited to learn something new and find
                            opportunities to build meaningful, human-focused tools.</p>
